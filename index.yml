title: My Health Log
author: Konuralp Bayrak, Rachel Magee
abstract: Most people today have busy lifestyles that revolve around their careers. These 
  habits brought on by the development of modern industry leave many susceptible to poor health 
  practices such as; poor diet, inadequate exercise, inadequate sleep, and cigarette 
  consumption. Our goal with My Health Log is to provide a simple tracking user interface for 
  everyday people to input their health information (height, weight, blood pressure, etc.) which 
  is stored on a per user basis. The data is stored and displayed on a secondary display page. 
  Along with a table display of the input data, there are also 3 chart figures showing the change 
  in each parameter over each entry. There are also messages displayed based on your health 
  progress. These customized messages are also hyperlinks to information on the health parameter 
  being tracked. The aim is to help people track their health and to provide information on how 
  to do so.
